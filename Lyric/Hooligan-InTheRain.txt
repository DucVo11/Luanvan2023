When I was young
Mama said the rain is not a friend
I didn’t know why, i was sad
Mama gave me a candy
But now whenever I cry in the rain
Someone helps me hide
He’s always my best friend, when I fall down
He never laughs

In the rain ! In the rain
Everything is ok, you will be ok
Hold me sway ! Hold me sway !
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
Ta di da da da ! Singing la la la
Let the rain wash away
Ta di da da da ! Singing la la la
Let the rain wash away

[Verse 2]
Everything wil be ok
Everything will be ok
Whenevеr I cry in the rain
Someone hеlps me hide
He’s always my best friend, when I fall down
He never laughs

[Chorus]
In the rain ! In the rain
Everything is ok, you will be ok
Hold me sway ! Hold me sway !
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
Ta di da da da ! Singing la la la
Let the rain wash away
Ta di da da da ! Singing la la la

[B]
Take me away, take me away
To the new highway
Take me away, take me away
In another day !
